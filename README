Zombies in a mall

- a learning exercise in git, canvas and javascript. Need braiiiiins!

Use arrow keys to move forwards, backwards and turn.
Zombies don't do any harm yet but they race towards player in line of sight.
Zombies can pass through doors (red)
Zombies can see through doors(red) and glass(blue)

Due to same-origin limits of getImageData the code needs to be hosted.
Try it here (but lots of &lt;F5&gt; if it isn't working - there's quite an aggressive cache)
